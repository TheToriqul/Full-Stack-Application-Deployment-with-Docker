# Full Stack Application Deployment With Docker

Welcome to the Full Stack Application Deployment With Docker project! üöÄ

This project demonstrates the power of Docker and Docker Compose in deploying a full stack application seamlessly on AWS EC2. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started with containerization, this project provides an excellent opportunity to dive into deploying complex applications with ease.

## Project Overview

Building and deploying full stack applications can be a daunting task, especially when it comes to managing dependencies, environments, and scaling. With Docker, we simplify this process by encapsulating each component of our application into containers, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

## Features

- **Client Service**: Frontend built with modern frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular.
- **API Services**: Backend services handling various aspects of the application logic.
- **Database Service**: Utilizing MySQL or another database management system to store and manage application data.
- **Worker Service**: Managing background tasks efficiently.
- **Redis**: Leveraging Redis for caching and message brokering.
- **Nginx**: Serving as a high-performance web server and reverse proxy for routing requests to the appropriate services.

## Why Docker?

- **Portability**: Docker containers can run on any platform, making deployment across different environments a breeze.
- **Isolation**: Each container encapsulates its dependencies, ensuring that applications run consistently regardless of the host environment.
- **Scalability**: Docker's lightweight nature enables effortless scaling of services horizontally or vertically as demand fluctuates.
- **DevOps Efficiency**: Docker streamlines the development-to-production workflow, empowering teams to ship code faster and with fewer errors.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheToriqul/Full-Stack-Application-Deployment-with-Docker.git
cd Full-Stack-Application-Deployment-with-Docker
```

2. **Set Environment Variables** (if needed):

If any environment variables are required, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and define the variables there.

3. **Build and Run the Docker Containers**:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

4. **Access the Application**:

Once the containers are up and running, access the application in your web browser using the public IP address of your AWS EC2 instance. Replace `localhost` with the public IP address.
